# WHAT IS C++?
1. C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
2. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
3. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
4. The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

# WHY USE C++?
1. C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
2. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
3. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
4. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
5. C++ is fun and easy to learn!
6. As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN C AND C++
1. C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
2. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

# NOTES
* "#include ..." kind of imports a library
* "using ..." is also a kind of library but from the actual language, i think
* you can ommit the "using ..." and put it in the code like this
    * Example
        using namespace std

        std::cout>> ...
